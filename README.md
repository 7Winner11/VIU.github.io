The BLA has been proven to be involved in the development of conditional fear. By using high (HIFU) or low (LIFU) intensity focused ultrasound on the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to modulate or ablate specific neural circuits, it is possible to develop rapid, non-invasive and non-pharmaceutical methods of fear memory therapy. This study aims to identify the effectiveness and importance of the reconsolidation hypothesis for CS-US tone shock pairings in rodents. Focused ultrasound could potentially pave the way for future methods of safe neuromodulation to inhibit emotional responses to associated memories. Ultrasound methods used today for treatment without the need of incisions or surgery leading to quicker and more accurate results within a clinical setting.
